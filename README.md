# Work-Day-Scheduler-
**Description of project**

This web application allows a user to have a virtual daily planner. The application establishes the time period of 9AM - 5PM and allows text entry into each of those time slots. When a user would like to save his/her entries, he/she has an option to do so by clicking the lock icons. Entries will be saved on the user's local storage. 

I was motivated to build this project as a way to enhance my skills with using Jquery and with using the moment.js function. This web application solves the need to not require a pen and paper to write down events throughout the day. It's a virtual daily planner.
